                </br>
                <p>Plan Asia Regional Office has implemented the solution for youth tracking and tracing with DHIS2 in Philippines
                    and Indonesia. Data is gathered on a variety of indicators, including employment status and multiple
                    socio-economic factors.
                </p>
                <p>Youth Unemployment is a major global crisis with significant social and economic repercussions. Several NGO’s
                    have rolled out employment and entrepreneurial skills building programs. In these programs, participants
                    are tracked to measure their attendance and progress and after they finish the program, they are supported
                    in finding a job or starting their own business. Alumni are traced through a variety of predominantly
                    labour intensive methods, such as phone calls and meetings to gather quantitative and qualitative data,
                    which is used to measure the impact of the programs.</p>
                <p>Key functions of the Youth Employment Solutions System include:</br>
                    • Creation of different workforce/entities in the system at different levels based on the reporting hierarchy, which will
                    involve organisations (business, training centre etc.), person profiles (beneficiary, trainers, mentors
                    etc.)
                    </br>
                    • Creating relationships between different kind of entities, such as beneficiary/mentor/trainer etc. to capture the flow
                    of information.</br>
                    • Creating various projects and interventions carried out by Plan International team and assigning them various entities
                    as mentioned above.</br>
                    • Capturing of client based information from the point of registration of the beneficiary in the system, to its enrolment
                    into respective projects and interventions collecting relevant data.</br>
                    • Creating ‘contact moments’ such as invitations for job fairs, seminars etc. and inviting the registered beneficiaries to
                    such events.</br>
                    • Tracking the beneficiaries who have been enrolled into projects and interventions, and entering data for the specific events
                    attended by the beneficiary.</br>
                    • Generation of indicators for each project, and allow for generation of custom reports, ad‐hoc reports and program specific
                    dashboards for monitoring and evaluation exercise. </br>
                    • Inbound and outbound communication mechanism in form of system alerts/reminders, outbound SMS etc. </br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unique Features:</br>
                    • Use of DHIS2 tracker for registration and tracking of youth for programs which provider employment solutions.</br>
                    • Link between beneficiaries, trainers, employers at different events of the program to track and analyse the status of the
                    beneficiary during, as well as after the completion of the program to understand the impact of the interventions.

                </br>
                <p>The 3Si project is an initiative by PSI India team with an objective to build an information system for easy
                    management of data coming from the project members for various events occurring over the cycle of a successful
                    toilet construction in the households of Bihar.
                </p>
                <p>The information system helps the PSI team to track and manage the progress in terms of constructing toilets
                    in households as per 3Si program.</p>
                <p>The application allows the field users to enter data for beneficiaries, track the progress in toilet construction
                    and also track the quality of the toilets constructed. The state project officers can then analyse the

                <p>About Acute Encephalitis Syndrome Surveillance </br>
                    • Capturing patient data generating from a three tiered laboratory based surveillance mechanism. </br>
                    • Suspected cases of AES who meet the case definition based on the reported symptoms are registered in the system. </br>
                    • Lab samples collected at district lab are tested, and also sent to Apex as well as NIMHANS lab. </br>
                    • Each district hospital lab is linked to an Apex lab which is the medical college laboratory which has infrastructure available
                    for carrying out tests for multiple pathogens.</br>
                    • NIMHANS lab, which is a state of the art laboratory infrastructure specializing in carrying out sophisticated laboratory
                    tests for pathogens causing encephalitis and meningitis.</br>
                </p>
                <p>How it works in DHIS2? </br>
                    • The data for patient's hospitalization outcome and the final diagnosis is entered at the level of district hospital. </br>
                    • SMS alerts have been inbuilt in the system, where the system send specific alerts to specific group of people such as identification
                    of any positive AES case via a confirmed lab result, and in order to maintain compliance necessary alerts
                    are generated on dispatch/acceptance of the specimen transported to the higher labs.</br>

                </br>
                <p>The Suaahara project funded by USAID Nepal has been successfully running for the last 4 years, and is now
                    moving towards its second phase with HKI being the primary implementer, and working in collaboration
                    with 6 other implementing partners, and taking support from community based organisations at the district
                    level. HKI and its implementing partners intend to use DHIS2 as their project data monitoring system
                    for tracking the key indicators to understand the key area of interventions, the impact on health status,
                    and making well-informed decision based on the data collected.
                </p>
                <p>The Suaahara II project is a five-year USAID-funded program, with a multi-sectoral approach based on a result
                    based framework. The overall goal of the program is to reduce the prevalence of nutrition related anomalies
                    such as being underweight, or suffering from stunting and wasting amongst the child population of less
                    than 5 years of age. In addition, the prevalence of anaemia is also monitored in mothers as well as children.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project has implementation scope in 40 districts, 38 of which were part of the Suaahara I program, and 17 of which were
                    implementing the Suaahara program since 2012 in Nepal. The Helen Keller International (HKI) is the lead
                    partner of Suaahara II, other partners include CARE, Equal Access, Environment, and Public Health Organization
                    (ENPHO), FHI360, Vijaya Development Resource Centre (VDRC), and Nutrition Technical Assistance Group
                    (NTAG).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project components aim to facilitate team behaviour changes including improving the household nutrition, sanitation,
                    and routine health measures, enhancing the use of quality nutrition and health services, increasing access
                    of households to quality nutrition rich food, and working with the local government to roll out a multi
                    sector nutrition plan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Key functions of the Suaahara II System includes:</br>
                    • Acting as data warehouse for all the activities covered under Suaahara II from different data collection sources such as
                    Commcare, ODK, and data entered in DHIS2.</br>
                    • Facilitate processing of data in form of indicators for analysis of data collected to measure the impact of interventions
                    taken by the Suaahara II project initiatives.</br>
                    • Design and development of dashboards for monitoring and evaluation of data through effective visualisations.</br>
                    • Dissemination of dashboards and reports to the defined user groups for them to have access to latest data and take effective
                    decisions.
